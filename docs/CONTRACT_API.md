# Contract API reference

Full signatures are in
[`contracts/ticketing/src/lib.rs`](../contracts/ticketing/src/lib.rs);
this is a quick-reference summary.

`get_ticket` and the legacy `verify_ticket` implementation return the same
`Ticket` record and error codes. `get_ticket` is the canonical Soroban naming
convention; `verify_ticket` is deprecated but remains available so existing
clients do not break. It may be removed only in a future breaking deployment.

## Error codes

See [`ERRORS.md`](ERRORS.md) for the full table of every `Error` variant
(1–41), which entry points return each one, and whether it is worth
retrying. The enum itself lives in
[`contracts/ticketing/src/error.rs`](../contracts/ticketing/src/error.rs).
